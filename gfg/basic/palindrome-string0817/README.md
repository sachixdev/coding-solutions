# Palindrome String

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given a string  **s**, find if it is a palindrome. A string is considered a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.

 **Examples :** 

```
Input: s = "abba"
Output: true
Explanation: "abba" reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome.
```

```
Input: s = "abc" 
Output: false
Explanation: "abc" does not read the same forwards and backwards, so it is not a palindrome.
```

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    bool isPalindrome(string& s) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = s.length() - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            if (s[left] != s[right]) {
                return false;
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }

        return true;
    }
};
```
