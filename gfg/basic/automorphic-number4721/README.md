# Automorphic Number

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given a number  **n**, check whether the number is an  **Automorphic**  number or not. A number is called an Automorphic number if and only if the  **square** of the number ends with the number itself.

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: n = 76
Output: Automorphic
Explanation: 762 = 5776
The square ends with 76, which is the original number. Hence, it is an Automorphic number.
```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: N = 14
Output: Not Automorphic
Explanation: 142 = 196
The square does not end with 14. Hence, it is not an Automorphic number.
```

 **Your Task:** 

You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function  **isAutomorphic**  **()** which takes n as input parameter and returns "Automorphic" if it is Automorphic number otherwise returns "Not Automorphic"(Without quotes).
 

 **Constranits:** 
1 <= n <= 1000

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    string isAutomorphic(int n) {
        int square = n * n;
        int temp = n;

        while (temp > 0) {
            if ((temp % 10) != (square % 10))
                return "Not Automorphic";

            temp /= 10;
            square /= 10;
        }

        return "Automorphic";
    }
};
```
