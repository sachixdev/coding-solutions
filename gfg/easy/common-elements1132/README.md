# Common in 3 Sorted Arrays

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given three sorted arrays in   non-decreasing   order, return all common elements in   non-decreasing   order across these arrays. If there are no such elements return an empty array.
 **Note:** Ignore duplicates, include each common element only once in the output.

 **Examples :** 

```
Input: a[] = [1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80], b[] = [6, 7, 20, 80, 100], c[] = [3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120]
Output: [20, 80]
Explanation: The elements 20 and 80 appear in all three arrays a, b, and c, making them the only common elements, so the output is [20, 80].
```

```
Input: a[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], b[] = [6, 7], c[] = [8, 9, 10]
Output: []
Explanation: Since none of the elements in arrays a, b, and c appear in all three arrays, there are no common elements, so the output is [].
```

```
Input:  a[] = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2], b[] = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2], c[] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]
Output: [1, 2]
Explanation: Ignoring duplicates, 1 and 2 are present in all three arrays, so the output is [1, 2].
```

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> commonElements(vector<int> &a, vector<int> &b, vector<int> &c) {
        vector<int> ans;

        int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;

        while (i < a.size() && j < b.size() && k < c.size()) {

            if (a[i] == b[j] && b[j] == c[k]) {

                if (ans.empty() || ans.back() != a[i])
                    ans.push_back(a[i]);

                i++;
                j++;
                k++;
            }
            else {
                int mn = min({a[i], b[j], c[k]});

                if (a[i] == mn) i++;
                else if (b[j] == mn) j++;
                else k++;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
