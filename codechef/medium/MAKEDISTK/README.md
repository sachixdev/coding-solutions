## Problem

### Make Distinct

You're given an array $A$ of length $N$, as well as an integer $K$.

You can perform the following operation on it:

- Choose at most $K$ distinct indices between $1$ and $N$.
- Increment the value at each chosen index by $1$.

Find the minimum number of operations of this type that you need to perform, to obtain an array $A$ where all the elements are pairwise distinct - i.e. $A_i \ne A_j$ must hold for $i \ne j$.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two lines of input. The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, \ldots, A_N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of operations needed to obtain an array with pairwise distinct elements.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq N \leq 2\cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le K \le N$
- $1 \le A_i \le 2N$
- The sum of $N$ over all test cases won't exceed $2\cdot 10^5$.

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  $A = [2, 1]$ already contains pairwise distinct elements, so no operations are needed.

 **Test case $2$:**  $A = [1, 1, 1, 1]$ initially, and we can increment at most $K = 2$ elements at once.
One sequence of $3$ operations is as follows:

- Increment the second and third elements. The array is now $[1, 2, 2, 1]$.
- Increment the second and fourth elements. The array is now $[1, 3, 2, 2]$.
- Increment the second and fourth elements again. The array is now $[1, 4, 2, 3]$. All the elements are now pairwise distinct.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

bool possible(int m, int k, vector<int>& a) {
    long long need = 0;
    int last = -1;

    for (int x : a) {
        int target = max(x, last + 1);

        // This element cannot be increased more than m times.
        if (target - x > m)
            return false;

        need += target - x;

        // Across m operations, at most m*k increments are possible.
        if (need > 1LL * m * k)
            return false;

        last = target;
    }

    return true;
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int T;
    cin >> T;

    while (T--) {
        int N, K;
        cin >> N >> K;

        vector<int> A(N);

        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
            cin >> A[i];

        sort(A.begin(), A.end());

        int lo = 0, hi = N;

        while (lo < hi) {
            int mid = (lo + hi) / 2;

            if (possible(mid, K, A))
                hi = mid;
            else
                lo = mid + 1;
        }

        cout << lo << '\n';
    }

    return 0;
}
```
