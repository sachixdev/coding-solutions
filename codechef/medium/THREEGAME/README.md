## Problem

### Three Player Game

You are organizing a simple $3$-player game. It consists of several rounds, each round being won by exactly one of the $3$ players.

You have decided to conduct at least $N$ rounds, but if after $N$ rounds there is no clear winner; you will conduct additional rounds till there is a clear winner. A clear winner is one who has won strictly more games than the other $2$ players.

Find the maximum number of rounds you may have to conduct.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first and only line of input contains a single integer $N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the maximum number of rounds you may have to conduct.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 10^9$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
1
2
3

```

```
1
4
4
```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case 1:**  After $1$ game, there is always a clear winner (the person who won that game).

 **Test Case 2:**  Here is a possible way the game could last $4$ rounds:

- Person $1$ wins round $1$.
- Person $2$ wins round $2$. $2$ games are up, but persons $1$ and $2$ are tied.
- Person $3$ wins round $3$. Everybody is tied.
- Person $3$ wins round $4$, and is the clear winner.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int T;
	cin >> T;
	while(T--){
	    long long N;
	    cin >> N;
	    long long ans = ((N + 2)/3)*3 + 1;
	    if(N % 3 == 1)
	        ans = N;
	    cout << ans << "\n";
	}
	return 0;

}

```
