## Problem

### Fumigation

Chef's house has $N$ rooms, which for some reason are arranged in a row. The rooms are numbered $1$ to $N$, from left to right.

Chef is dealing with a pest problem, and so has no choice but to fumigate his house.

A fumigation machine has three parameters: the distance it can travel, $X$; its spraying strength, $Y$; and its linger period, $Z$.
A fumigation machine with parameters $(X, Y, Z)$ behaves as follows:

- It will start at room $1$.
- Then, every second, repeat the following: Suppose the machine is currently at position $p$. It will move to some position $q \in [1, N]$ such that $|p-q| \le X$. Then, it will spray fog into rooms $q, q+1, \ldots, \min(N, q+Y-1)$. The sprayed fog will remain in these rooms for the next $Z$ seconds, i.e. if the spraying was done at time $t$ then it will be present at times $t, t+1, \ldots, t+Z-1$.

Chef thinks his house is  *safe*  if there exists an instant of time in which  **every**  room contains fog, simultaneously.

Buying a powerful machine naturally costs more.
In particular, you are given three parameters $A, B,$ and $C$; meaning that buying a machine with parameters $(X, Y, Z)$ costs $AX + BY + CZ$ coins.

Find the minimum number of coins Chef must spend in order to buy a machine that can possibly result in his house being  *safe*, if the movements of the machine are made optimally.

Note that each of $X, Y,$ and $Z$ must be  **positive integers**  for the bought machine.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing four space-separated integers $N, A, B, C$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the minimum cost of making Chef's house safe.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq N \leq 2\cdot 10^6$
- $1 \le A, B, C \le 10^9$
- The sum of $N$ over all test cases won't exceed $2\cdot 10^6$.

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  There's only one room. Choose $(X, Y, Z) = (1, 1, 1)$ and immediately spray fog into room $1$ since we start there. This has a cost of $4+7+3 = 14$, and is clearly minimum since we're constrained to have $X, Y, Z \ge 1$.

 **Test case $2$:**  There are two rooms. One solution is to choose $(X, Y, Z) = (1, 1, 2)$ and do the following:

- Second $1$: spray in room $1$. Since $Y = 1$ only this room is sprayed. Since $Z = 2$, this room will have fog in it for the next $2$ seconds.
- Second $2$: move and spray room $2$. Room $2$ now has fog, and room $1$ still has fog; so we're done.

The cost of this is $1+1+1\cdot 2 = 4$.
