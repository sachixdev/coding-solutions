## Problem

### Chairs Requirement

Chef's coding class is very famous in Chefland.

This year $X$ students joined his class and each student will require one chair to sit on. Chef already has $Y$ chairs in his class. Determine the minimum number of new chairs Chef must buy so that every student is able to get one chair to sit on.

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $T$ — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $X$ and $Y$ — the number of students in the class and the number of chairs Chef already has.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the minimum number of extra chairs Chef must buy so that every student gets one chair.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $0 \leq X, Y \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
20 14
41 41
35 0
50 100

```

```
6
0
35
0

```

### Explanation:
- Test case 1: There are $20$ students in the class and Chef has $14$ chairs already. Therefore Chef must buy $6$ more chairs.
- Test case 2: There are $41$ students in the class and Chef already has exactly $41$ chairs. Therefore Chef does not need to buy any more chairs.
- Test case 3: There are $35$ students in the class and Chef has no chairs initially. Therefore Chef must buy $35$ chairs.

using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t; cin>>t;
	while(t--)
	{
	    int x, y; cin>>x>>y;
	    int d= x-y;
	    if(d>=0)
	    {
	        cout<<d<<endl;
	    }
	    else
	    {
	        cout<<"0"<<endl;
	    }
	    
	}
	return 0;
}
```
